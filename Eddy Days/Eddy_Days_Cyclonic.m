%% Calculate eddy day -- Cyclonic Eddies

% "Eddy Days" is calculated for each month of a given year. This script measures the
% total cyclonic eddies intersecting with a given polygon (study area) for that
% month. 3 Eddy Days could be the same eddy intersecting with the study area on 3
% separate days or 3 different eddies intersecting with the study area on
% the same day

% The third section must be ran for all years in the dataset

%% Load the shapefile -- in this project, we used a buffer for the Flower Garden Banks Sanctuary boundaries
% It will take any shapefile -- could be any study area, or a buffer around the study area -- and make a polyshape object

cd '/Volumes/SeascapeLab/Limer/FGB EddyScan Data/FGB Boundary Buffers'; % Shapefile path
buffer_STRUCT = shaperead('FGB_Buffer_25km.shp'); 
buffer_X = buffer_STRUCT.X;
buffer_Y = buffer_STRUCT.Y;
buffer = vertcat(buffer_X, buffer_Y)';
buffer = polyshape(buffer);

%% Cyclonic Eddy Day calculation by month
cd '/Volumes/SeascapeLab/Limer/FGB EddyScan Data/2018/Eddy Perimeter Data/'; % Path to Eddy Perimeters
load 'cyclonic.mat';

% Given the cyclonic eddy perimeters loaded, the following loops will
% generate "Eddy Days" for each month of year. Each month will have its own
% variable
